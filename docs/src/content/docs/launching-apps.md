title: Launching apps
---

Every launch path produces the same `App` custom resource — the UI and API are conveniences
over one contract, so behavior is identical regardless of how an app was created.

This pack deploys **static apps only** (HTML/CSS/JS served by nginx). For Python services,
use [python-capability-pack](https://github.com/nebari-dev/python-capability-pack).

## Sources

| Source | Best for | How it runs |
|---|---|---|
| `inline` | small sites (text assets, ~900KB) | Files carried in the `App` resource, served by nginx (unprivileged) on 8080. |
| `git` | version-controlled sites | A non-root init container clones the repo; nginx serves the content root. |
| `pvc` | larger sites, existing volumes | An existing PersistentVolumeClaim mounted as the content root. |

## From the UI

Open `https://apps.<cluster-domain>`:

1. **Launch app** → name, display name, and namespace.
2. **Source** — **Upload** (a `.zip` of your site or a single `.html` file) or **Git**.
3. **Runtime** — replicas, CPU/memory requests, environment variables.
4. **Access** — public toggle, allowed groups, and the subdomain.

The dashboard tracks the rollout; the app's detail page shows conditions, live pod logs,
and Kubernetes events, plus stop/start/delete.

## Uploading files

Uploads accept a **zip archive** or a **single `.html` file**:

- Archives need an `index.html` at their root (a single top-level folder is flattened).
- Text assets only (`.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.json`, `.svg`, …) up to ~900KB total — the
  files are carried inline in the `App` resource and materialized as a ConfigMap-backed
  volume. Bigger sites or binary assets should use a `git` or `pvc` source.

Via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://apps.example.ai/api/v1/apps/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F 'manifest={"name":"docs-site","namespace":"apps","displayName":"Docs Site",
                "access":{"public":true,"subdomain":"docs-site"}}' \
  -F "file=@site.zip"
```

## From the API

```bash
curl -X POST https://apps.example.ai/api/v1/apps \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "team-site",
    "namespace": "apps",
    "displayName": "Team Site",
    "source": {"type": "git", "git": {"url": "https://github.com/org/site", "ref": "main", "subdir": "public"}},
    "runtime": {"replicas": 1, "env": [{"name": "LOG_LEVEL", "value": "info"}]},
    "access": {"public": false, "groups": ["analysts"], "subdomain": "team-site"}
  }'
```

See the [REST API reference](/api-reference/) for the full surface.

## From kubectl

Write the `App` resource directly — useful for GitOps:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.nebari.dev/v1alpha1
kind: App
metadata:
  name: team-site
  namespace: apps
spec:
  displayName: "Team Site"
  source:
    type: git
    git:
      url: https://github.com/org/site
      ref: main
      subdir: public
  access:
    public: false
    groups: ["analysts"]
    subdomain: team-site
```

The namespace must carry the `nebari.dev/managed=true` label. See the
[App CRD reference](/app-crd-reference/) for every field.

## From an agent (MCP)

Coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, or any MCP client) can launch and manage apps with
natural language through the **apps-mcp** server — `launch_app` is idempotent on
(namespace, name), so re-launching updates instead of failing. See the
[MCP server](/mcp/) page for connection and authentication details.

## Access control

- **`access.public: true`** — no authentication; anyone with the URL.
- **Private (default)** — the app's `NebariApp` creates a gateway `SecurityPolicy`: users
  are redirected to Keycloak, and only `access.groups` members are authorized (empty
  groups = any signed-in user). The app itself never sees or handles auth.

## Day-2 operations

| Action | UI | API | kubectl |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stop (scale to 0) | detail page → Stop | `POST .../apps/{ns}/{name}/stop` | set `spec.runtime.replicas: 0` |
| Start | detail page → Start | `POST .../apps/{ns}/{name}/start` | set `spec.runtime.replicas: 1` |
| Update | detail page → Edit | `PATCH .../apps/{ns}/{name}` | edit the CR |
| Restart (roll pods) | detail page → Restart | `POST .../apps/{ns}/{name}/restart` | `kubectl rollout restart deploy/app-<name>` |
| Logs | detail page → Logs | `GET .../apps/{ns}/{name}/logs` | `kubectl logs -l apps.nebari.dev/app=<name>` |
| Metrics | Metrics page / detail cards | `GET .../apps/{ns}/{name}/metrics`, `GET /analytics/metrics` | `kubectl top pods -l apps.nebari.dev/app=<name>` |
| Delete | detail page → Delete (type to confirm) | `DELETE .../apps/{ns}/{name}` | `kubectl delete app <name>` |

Changing inline content rolls the pods automatically (the pod template carries a content
checksum), so an update is always a clean redeploy.
